# Generic Query Logger README

This README outlines the functionality and usage of the Generic Query Logger (GQL), a versatile tool designed for querying specific namespaces, aggregating information, and logging responses for further analysis. The GQL is particularly useful for applications requiring dynamic querying across various datasets or "namespaces" and seeks concise, relevant information processed through language models.

## Overview

The Generic Query Logger allows users to query information from specified namespaces, process this information through a GPT model (like GPT-3.5-turbo), and log the queries and responses for analysis. It's designed to be flexible, accommodating various subjects or domains by altering the namespace prefix used in queries.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Namespace Querying**: Dynamically queries across multiple namespaces based on a user-defined prefix.
- **Automated Information Aggregation**: Combines results from multiple namespaces for comprehensive processing.
- **GPT Model Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models for generating responses based on aggregated information.
- **Logging**: Logs both the query prompts and GPT-generated responses for subsequent analysis.

## Setup

Before using the GQL, ensure you have the necessary environment and dependencies set up:

1. **Python 3.8+**: Make sure Python 3.8 or newer is installed.
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI for accessing GPT models.
3. **Dependencies**: Install necessary Python packages like `openai`, which can be done via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

## Usage

To use the GQL, follow these steps:

1. **Import and Configuration**: Import the script and configure it with your OpenAI API key and desired model.
2. **Define Namespaces**: Determine the namespaces you will query. These should be reflective of the distinct databases or datasets you aim to query against.
3. **Query Execution**: Execute a query by calling `generic_query(query_text, namespace_prefix)` with your specific query text and the relevant namespace prefix.
4. **Review Logs**: Check the generated CSV logs for the queries and responses.

### Namespace Strategy

Namespaces are a core concept in the GQL, acting as identifiers for specific databases or datasets from which you want to pull information. When a user inputs a query, the GQL dynamically creates namespace strings using a provided prefix, enabling selective querying across multiple datasets.

#### Examples of Namespace Usage:

- **Selective Databases**: If you have separate databases for product information, customer feedback, and internal documentation, you could prefix these with `product_`, `feedback_`, and `docs_`, respectively. By querying with these prefixes, you can selectively search within these distinct data realms.
- **Temporal Data**: For querying information from different time periods, prefixes like `2023Q1_`, `2023Q2_` could be used to target specific quarters.
- **Geographical Information**: For location-specific queries, use prefixes like `US_`, `EU_`, to focus on data relevant to those regions.

### Best Practices

- **Clear Prefix Naming**: Choose clear, descriptive prefixes for your namespaces to easily identify the target dataset.
- **Consistent Logging**: Regularly review your query and response logs to refine your queries and improve the system's effectiveness.
- **Security**: Ensure your logs do not store sensitive information without proper security measures in place.

## Conclusion

The Generic Query Logger is a powerful tool for querying across multiple datasets, leveraging GPT models for information processing, and logging interactions for analysis. By utilizing dynamic namespaces, it offers flexibility and precision in querying, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from business intelligence to academic research.
