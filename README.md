# Generic Query Logger README

This README outlines the functionality and usage of the Generic Query Logger (GQL), a versatile tool designed for querying specific namespaces, aggregating information, and logging responses for further analysis. The GQL is particularly useful for applications requiring dynamic querying across various datasets or "namespaces" and seeks concise, relevant information processed through language models.

## Overview

The Generic Query Logger allows users to query information from specified namespaces, process this information through a GPT model (like GPT-3.5-turbo), and log the queries and responses for analysis. It's designed to be flexible, accommodating various subjects or domains by altering the namespace prefix used in queries.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Namespace Querying**: Dynamically queries across multiple namespaces based on a user-defined prefix.
- **Automated Information Aggregation**: Combines results from multiple namespaces for comprehensive processing.
- **GPT Model Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models for generating responses based on aggregated information.
- **Logging**: Logs both the query prompts and GPT-generated responses for subsequent analysis.

### Best Practices

- **Clear Prefix Naming**: Choose clear, descriptive prefixes for your namespaces to easily identify the target dataset.
- **Consistent Logging**: Regularly review your query and response logs to refine your queries and improve the system's effectiveness.
- **Security**: Ensure your logs do not store sensitive information without proper security measures in place.
